Listen up, okay? I'm not doing this because I care about you or anything, but I'm giving you permission (yep, totally free, so don't get a big head) to use this software and all its accompanying documentation files (the "Software") however you please. You can use it, copy it, modify it, merge it, publish it, distribute it, sublicense it, and even sell copies of it. Not that I believe you could ever match its brilliance on your own, but go ahead and try.

However, don't mess this up: you must include this very copyright notice and this permission notice in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. Seriously, if you forget, I'm not going to be happy about it.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" – and, for the love of everything, don't expect any warranties. There are absolutely no guarantees of any kind, whether express or implied – not even a smidgeon of warranty regarding merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or noninfringement. If something goes wrong (and, let's be real, it might, given your track record), neither I nor the copyright holders are liable for any claims, damages, or other liabilities. 
Whether it's due to contract, tort, or any other excuse you come up with, you're on your own. Not that I'm worried – just don't come crying to me!

So there, take it or leave it. And don't get the wrong idea – I'm not doing this because I like you or anything. It's just the way it is!
